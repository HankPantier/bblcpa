 * Playwright E2E config. Run with `npm run test:e2e`.

 * Spins up the production build (`npm run build && npm run start`) before
 * tests run, then tears it down. Single chromium project keeps CI fast;
 * the tests are smoke-grade and don't need cross-browser coverage to be
 * useful. If you ever want Firefox / WebKit too, add projects to the array.
 *
 * `npx playwright install chromium` is a one-time setup step in any
 * environment (CI or local) that hasn't run Playwright before.
